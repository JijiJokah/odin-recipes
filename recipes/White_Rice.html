            <li>Turn stove top to high. Place rice pot with rice on stove top, and wait for water to begin boiling </li>
            <li>Give the rice a quick stir, then cover the rice, and reduce to a low simmer. </li>
            <li>Allow to cook for 12-15 minutes</li>
            <li>The rice should be well cooked at this point. Remove from simmer, and give it a quick stir to fluff.</li>
